Holding
There are four ways of holding back packages: with dpkg, apt, aptitude or dselect.

dpkg
Put a package on hold:

echo "<package-name> hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections
Remove the hold:

echo "<package-name> install" | sudo dpkg --set-selections
Display the status of your packages:

dpkg --get-selections
Display the status of a single package:

dpkg --get-selections | grep "<package-name>"
apt
Hold a package:

sudo apt-mark hold <package-name>
Remove the hold:

sudo apt-mark unhold <package-name>
Show all packages on hold:

sudo apt-mark showhold
dselect
With dselect, enter the [S]elect screen, find the package you wish to hold in its present state and press = or H. The changes will take effect immediately after exiting the [S]elect screen.

The following approaches are limited in that locking/holding a package within aptitude or synaptic doesn't affect apt-get/apt.

aptitude
Hold a package:

sudo aptitude hold <package-name>
Remove the hold:

sudo aptitude unhold <package-name>
Locking with Synaptic Package Manager
Go to Synaptic Package Manager (System > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager).

Click the search button and type the package name.

When you find the package, select it and go to the Package menu and select Lock Version.
