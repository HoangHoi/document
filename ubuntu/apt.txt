apt-get

You can run a simulation to see what would happen if you upgrade/install a package:

apt-get -s install <package>
To see all possible upgrades, run a upgrade in verbose mode and (to be safe) with simulation, press n to cancel:

apt-get -V -s upgrade
apt-cache

The option policy can show the installed and the remote version (install candidate) of a package.

apt-cache policy <package>
apt-show-versions

If installed, shows version information about one or more packages:

apt-show-versions <package>
Passing the -u switch with or without a package name will only show upgradeable packages.

aptitude

The console GUI of aptitude can display upgradeable packages with new versions. Open the menu 'Upgradable Packages'. Pressing v on a package will show more detailed version information.

Or on the command-line:

aptitude versions <package>
Passing -V will show detailed information about versions, again to be safe with the simulation switch:

aptitude -V -s install <package>
Substituting install <package> with upgrade will show the versions from all upgradeable packages.
