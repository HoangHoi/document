# 1. Boot from the live CD or live USB, in "Try Ubuntu" mode.
# 2. Determine the partition number of your main partition.
sudo fdisk -l

# 3. Mount your partition:
sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt  #Replace sda2 with the partition from step 2

# 4. If you have a separate /boot, /var or /usr partitions, repeat steps 2 and 3 to mount these partitions to /mnt/boot, /mnt/var and /mnt/usr respectively
sudo mount /dev/sdXW /mnt/boot
sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/var
sudo mount /dev/sdXZ /mnt/usr

# 5. Bind mount some other necessary stuff
for i in /sys /proc /run /dev; do sudo mount --bind "$i" "/mnt$i"; done

# 6. If Ubuntu is installed in EFI mode
sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/boot/efi

# 7. Chroot into your Ubuntu install
sudo chroot /mnt

# 8. At this point, you're in your install, not the live session, and running as root. Update grub
update-grub

# 9. If you get errors or if going up to step 7 didn't fix your problem, go to step 8. Reinstall grub and Update grub
grub-install /dev/sda
update-grub

# 10. If everything worked without errors, then you're all set:
exit
sudo reboot
