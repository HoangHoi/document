You can create a section [color] in your ~/.gitconfig with e.g. the following content

[color]
  diff = auto
  status = auto
  branch = auto
  interactive = auto
  ui = true
  pager = true
You can also fine control what you want to have coloured in what way, e.g.

[color "status"]
  added = green
  changed = red bold
  untracked = magenta bold

[color "branch"]
  remote = yellow
