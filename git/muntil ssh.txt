I recently had to do this and had to sift through all these answers and their comments to eventually piece the information together, so I'll put it all here, in one post, for your convenience:


Step 1: ssh keys
Create any keypairs you'll need. In this example I've named me default/original 'id_rsa' (which is the default) and my new one 'id_rsa-work':

ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "stefano@work.com"


Step 2: ssh config
Set up multiple ssh profiles by creating/modifying ~/.ssh/config. Note the slightly differing 'Host' values:

# Default GitHub
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Work GitHub
Host work.github.com
    HostName github.com
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work


Step 3: 
Ensure ssh-agent is enabled:
$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)

Ssh-add: You may or may not have to do this. To check, list identity fingerprints by running:

$ ssh-add -l
2048 1f:1a:b8:69:cd:e3:ee:68:e1:c4:da:d8:96:7c:d0:6f stefano (RSA)
2048 6d:65:b9:3b:ff:9c:5a:54:1c:2f:6a:f7:44:03:84:3f stefano@work.com (RSA)

If your entries aren't there then run:

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work


Step 4: test
To test you've done this all correctly, I suggest the following quick check:

$ ssh -T git@github.com
Hi stefano! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

$ ssh -T git@work.github.com
Hi stefano! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

Note that you'll have to change the hostname (github / work.github) depending on what key/identity you'd like to use. But now you should be good to go! :)

#if error Bad owner or permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
