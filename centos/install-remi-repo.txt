HOW TO ENABLE AND USE REMI REPO
The easy and instant way can be done using this command:

1
yum --enablerepo=remi [command] [package name]
Replace the [command] part with one of these:

– install
– update
– check-update
– upgrade
– remove or erase
– list
– provides or whatprovides
– search
– info
– clean
– shell
– resolvedep
– localinstall
– localupdate
– deplist

or, alternatively you can also enable Remi repo using these steps:

Step 1 – Edit the remi.repo file using your favorite text editor like vi or Nano:

1
nano /etc/yum.repos.d/remi.repo
Step 2 – Find the line enabled = 0 and change it to 1 to enable REMI repository:

1
2
3
[...]
enabled=1
[...]
Step 3 – Now save that file and close it. In Nano it is Control+O then Control+X.

Step 4 – Then issue the yum repolist command again to double check it:

1
yum repolist
Step 5 – You can now use usual yum command to install, update or delete any package.

1
yum [command] [package name]
for example:

1
yum install php
